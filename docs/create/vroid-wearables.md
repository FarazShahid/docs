This guide is to teach you how to customize a VRM avatar that was created in [VRoid studio](https://vroid.com/en/studio). Note, the first part is tailored to custom avatars you made in the studio program.

If you downloaded a VRM file from [VRoid Hub](https://hub.vroid.com/) and wanted to accessorize scroll down below to wearables.

## How it Works

First open VRoid Studio and go to the clothing tab. Check out the different presets available and play with the sliders to get a feel for editing the base. Then go to the texture tab. Layers are similar to the layers in programs like Photoshop or Gimp.


Customing VRoids involves mostly image editing the textures for each wearable type. You can right click a layer to import/export a clothing texture. For sample files of all the different clothes check out: https://github.com/madjin/vrm-samples/tree/master/vroid

You can edit the clothing files in an image editor then import it back to VRoid studio via a layer.


Cut and sew is done with alpha channels, so if you wanted an open jacket you would edit the texture to be transparent in the middle.

When ready, go to the export tab on the top right and export a VRM. Done!
